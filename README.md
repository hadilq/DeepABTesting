### Deep A/B Testing 
From the title I hope you get the point of this idea! Also in some interviews I explained it to grab some attention, 
so you may have heard about it. By the way, I can explain it anyway! First, let me explain what is an A/B test. 
The idea of A/B testing is that you create some virtual branches in your code, where you can control switching 
between these branches remotely. So you can remotely distribute different branches to people, and measure some 
conversions of events to find out which branch is more suitable for the **majority** of users. After that you find 
out this branch is the winner, you would remove the other branches with the same base(Think of base like what we have 
in git) all together, so every user would use the winner branch. Hah! What about the users who are in **minorities** 
and the removed branches are their perfect choices? YOU WILL LOSS THEM in some levels!

Another aspect of this idea is deep learning. You may know the deep learning is so suite to humanâ€™s non-linear 
behaviour, so with this simple argument I fall to think about just using deep learning and TensorFlowLite in this project.

Finally, the idea here is to let the machine learning model fragments your user to use the combination of those 
branches.
